cas-sc.cls and cas-dc.cls are the two new class files created
for typesetting Elsevier's journal articles which go through
Complex Article Service (CAS) workflow. These are now accepted for
submitting articles, both in Elsevier's electronic submission system
and elsewhere.

Bugs and problems with elsarticle.cls may be reported to the
developers of the class via elsarticle@stmdocs.in.

The file manifest.txt provides a list of the files in the
elsarticle-cas bundle.  The following are the main files available:

- cas-sc-template.tex, template file for single column journals
- cas-dc-template.tex, template file for double column journals
- cas-sc-template.pdf, PDF of the cas-sc-template.tex 
- cas-dc-template.pdf, PDF of the cas-ddc-template.tex
- cas-common.sty, additional macro package for formatting
  model2-names.bst, BibTeX style file
- twitter.jpeg, linkedin.jpeg, url.jpeg, gplus.jpeg, facebook.jpeg,
  email.jpeg - thumbnail images of social networking sites

The documentation file is elsdoc-cas.tex in the doc directory.  To
compile it:

1. pdflatex elsdoc-cas
2. pdflatex elsdoc-cas
3. pdflatex elsdoc-cas

or

use the makefile. Use the target `all' (eg: make all) in doc
directory.

The above procedure will create a print version, namely elsdoc-cas.pdf.
